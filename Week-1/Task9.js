// Create a program that declares variables with different data types: a number (age), a string (name), and a boolean (isStudent). Perform operations like concatenating the name with a greeting, converting the age to a string, and combining the boolean value with a string to form a sentence. Print the results.

let age=22;
let name="Vraj";
let boolean=true;

console.log("Hello, My name is" + " " + name+".");
console.log("My age is" + " " + age.toString()+".");
console.log("I am a student: " + boolean.toString());
